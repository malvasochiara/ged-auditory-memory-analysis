% Why this dumb name? I chose it because I wanted to distinguish the
% function to perform GED when Listening and resting were divided before
% source reconstruction. This refer to a differente dataset, the one in the
% folder GED_scripts2, that didn't have a Ã¨proper resting state, it had to
% be extracted between trials. Long story short, don't care about the name
% and maybe change it because it's stupid.
% Loads a single subject, computed GED on it and store the data in a .mat
% file. Covariance matrices are computed on concatenated trials
% 
% INPUTS :  -S.filenameNarrow  = name of the narrowband file
